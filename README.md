# DataStructures-And-Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms with implementations in C++ and some Java. It includes various algorithms (sorting, searching, graphs, etc.) and data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.), along with solutions to problems I find interesting..  Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
